# MemoryGame---10-minute-challenge
Test memory game I made for a ten minute challenge (no time + no stack XD) - so it's fairly simple. --> README for more detail.

A simple reaction / memory game. You are shown (1 of 4) random letters, and attempt to remember them and type them back. Code goes faster as you continue, and you attempt to read and remember the letter in less and less time. Game ends when you reply with the wrong letter.
